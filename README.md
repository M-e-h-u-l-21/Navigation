#### ZENIFY-Key to a Better Self

#### Problem Statement- 
As found by the APMS ,1 in 6 people experience a common mental health problem. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems, with around 1 in 10 people affected at any one time. In todayâ€™s hectic life people keep mental health on a secondary pedestal.


#### Proposed Solution- 
We have tried creating an app with such a environment that assists people to focus on mental health by providing a platform where they can positively discuss their depression and anxiety and can soothingly meditate by keeping track of time.

#### Functionalities & Concepts Used- 

->Recycler View and Card View

->Buttons

->Firebase

## Lessons Learned

We all learned about different types of features present in android studio and also we cam across some basic terminologies used in Git.

Being a beginner, we all had only the idea of our project but to implement it and create a product out of it was a gigantic task.We used the course provided by Google to learn the basic working of android studio and different applications of features.

We're also fortunate to have seniors that guided us through any error/problem that we faced during the project. We are immensly grateful to them.
